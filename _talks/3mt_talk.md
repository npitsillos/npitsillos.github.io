Presented my research work to an audience, keeping the talk within a 3 minute interval.  No jargon was encouraged since this was a non-expert audience.  Presenting without using jargon is quite the challenge since one needs to explain most of the technical terms or not use them entirely.  Given the daily communication with other members of my group who are aware of my research and where jargon is always used this competition provided a good platform on which to practice talking about my work.  It pushed me to distill my work in a 3 minute presentation using a single slide but also enabled me to reduce it down to a non-specialist level so that people from a wide range of research fields could find it accessible.

Definitely recommend this competition to people who look to improve their communication skills! I didn't manage to advance to the finals or achieve one of the runner up positions but it was definitely a rewarding experience, not only because I got the chance to present and think about my research in a more general way but also because it made me realise the numerous fascinating research fields that are out there!
