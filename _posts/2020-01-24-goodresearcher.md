Instead of spending time thinking about how to push my work forward or read papers and brainstorm for ideas, lately I begun thinking a lot about different ways to be on top of things during my PhD life as I hastily try to read many papers in a futile attempt to cover a lot of the literature around my topic.  Given the hype around AI it is overwhelmingly difficult to keep up to date with the literature while carrying out experiments or learning the tools that most of your work will utilise.

One of the most important parts of the PhD in my opinion is to find a method that works for you and through my attempt to do so I have reached at the following question:

> ## What makes a good researcher?

Now to be clear I understand that it takes much more than what I'll talk about in this post, however I believe these two skills to be at the core.

# Skill 1: Organisation

At the core of being a good researcher comes organisation.  Being chaotic in terms of how you organise meetings with supervisors, your reading list or what you have to do in a day can all contribute many difficulties in the work you will embark on during your PhD and research career in general.

I found that not having set a specific time for an activity or tracking your week effectively can significantly reduce your productivity.  It can also have a negative impact on future endeavours. For example, being disorganised can lead to losing sight of important goals or difficulties in gathering material for writing a paper or even your thesis!

Organisation therefore is key for me in progressing in my work.  Without some form of organisation that suits me I would have found it hard to remember what I have done and why, how am I spending my time and on what.

# Skill 2: Consistency
Maybe consistency goes hand in hand with probably everything one does and wants to improve upon but sometimes it wasn't that clear to me.  I would always wonder how researchers come up with these ideas or how do they actually go from idea generation to testing whether it works.

I have realised over the past months that without actively sitting down and thinking about the problem you wish to tackle then the chances of actually coming up with an idea are completely determined by sheer luck.  This does not mean however that you can't actually come up with ideas if you are having a bad break.  Simply dedicating a time to read, no matter the frequency, gets you into the mindset of actively thinking about your problem.  

It is difficult to read a paper, however over time one gets accustomed to this process and gets a keen eye for what is revelant or not and therefore where to focus on, provided one is consistent.  This does not only apply to reading papers.  This can apply to all aspects of a PhD.  Working hours, keeping notes of ideas or what you did, the list goes on.  Just sticking to a single process will allow you to reap the benefits in the long run by enduring the pain in the short run.

# Conclusion
Now of course this is all good in theory.  In reality things change, and especially in research, uncertainty is all over the place and you can't possibly hope to always be consistent or organised.  Whether it may be deadlines that are creeping up or simply the pressure of having many things you need to do, you are bound to lose hope sometimes and that is **OK**.  Through the practice of organisation and consistency the number of times you will feel as if what is ahead of you is a Herculian task will decrease.  And you will learn to embrace that feeling.

The reason for writing about these two skills is because through these you can gain even more.  Organisation can lead to efficiency and productivity and consistency can lead to patience in enduring the difficulties and uncertainties you will face. Because after all, we do embark on a journey towards the unknown...
