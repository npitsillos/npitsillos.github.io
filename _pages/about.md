I am a PhD student at [UoG](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) and a member of the [Computer Vision & Autonomous Systems](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/computervisionandautonomoussystems/) group.

My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.  My PhD is focussed in treating the hidden neural network activations in deep neural networks as learnable data in order to learn about the activity of neural networks.  My work is motivated by the process of introspection.

In my free time I like to exercise, bake sourdough bread and develop simple tools to help me in my work.
